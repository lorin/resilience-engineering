# Laws, tradeoffs and theorems

Many of these are documented in [Beyond Simon’s Slice: Five Fundamental Trade-Offs that Bound the Performance of Macrocognitive Work Systems]
by Hoffman and Woods.

## Laws

### Law of fluency

Well-adapted cognitive work occurs with a facility that belies the difficulty
of resolving demands and balancing dilemmas

Source: [Beyond Simon’s Slice: Five Fundamental Trade-Offs that Bound the Performance of Macrocognitive Work Systems]

### Law of stretched systems

Every system is stretched to operate at its capacity. 

Sources:

* [Beyond Simon’s Slice: Five Fundamental Trade-Offs that Bound the Performance of Macrocognitive Work Systems]

This law is attributed to Lawrence Hirschhorn, and has been popularized by David Woods and Richard Cook.

### Law of requisite variety

The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the
variety of perturbations it is able to compensate.

This is also called the first law of cybernetics or Ashby's law.

### Laws of the adaptive universe

* Resources are finite
* Surprise is fundamental
* Change never stops

### Law of coordinative entropy

Coordination costs, continuously.

### Law of systems as surrogates

Technology reflects the stances, agendas, and goals of those who design and deploy the technology. 

Source: [Beyond Simon’s Slice: Five Fundamental Trade-Offs that Bound the Performance of Macrocognitive Work Systems]

### Mr. Weasley's Law

Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.

Source: [Beyond Simon’s Slice: Five Fundamental Trade-Offs that Bound the Performance of Macrocognitive Work Systems]

### The Law of the Kludge

Work systems always require workarounds, with resultant kludges that attempt
to bridge the gap between the original design objectives and current realities
or to reconcile conflicting goals among workers.

### First law of cooperative systems

It's not cooperation, if either you do it all or I do it all.

Source: David Woods. Not sure where he first wrote this, but it's referenced in *Cognitive Systems Engineering: The Future for a Changing World*

### (Robin) Murphy's Law

Any deployment of robotic systems will fall short of the target level of autonomy, creating or exacerbating a shortfall
in mechanisms for coordination with human stakeholders.

Source: This is mentioned in [Joint Cognitive Systems: Patterns in Cogntive Systems Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Joint-Cognitive-Systems-Patterns-Engineering-ebook/dp/B00918NQOE/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=joint+cognitive+systems&qid=1557092907&s=gateway&sr=8-1), Chapter 10 (Automation Surprises).

## Tradeoffs

### Efficiency-thoroughness tradeoff

People (and organisations) as part of their activities frequently – or always –
have to make a trade-off between the resources (primarily time and effort) they
spend on preparing to do something and the resources (primarily time and
effort) they spend on doing it.

### Optimality-brittleness tradeoff

The pursuit of increases in optimality with respect to some criteria 
guarantees an increase in brittleness with respect to changes or variations
that fall outside of those criteria.

## Theorems

### Theorems of graceful extensibility

* *UAB* stands for unit of adaptive behavior
* *CfM* stands for capacity for manoeuvre

1. Adaptive capacity is finite
2. Events will produce demands that challenge boundaries on the adaptive
   capacity of any UAB
3. Adaptive capacities are regulated to manage the risk of saturating CfM
4. No UAB can have sufficient ability to regulate CfM to manage the risk of saturation alone
5. Some UABs monitor and regulate the CfM of other UABs in response to changes
   in the risk of saturation
6. Adaptive capacity is the potential for adjusting patterns of action to
   handle future situations, events, opportunities and disruptions
7. Performance of a UAB as it approaches saturation is different from the
   performance of that UAB when it operates far from saturation
8. All UABs are local
9. There are bounds on the perspective any UAB, but these limits are overcome
   by shifts and contrasts over multiple perspectives.
10. Reflective systems risk mis-calbiration
